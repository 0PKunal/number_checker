## 🎯 About

This project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts including:
- Basic input/output operations
- Conditional statements
- Modulo arithmetic
- Integer handling

Perfect for beginners learning C programming and understanding odd/even number logic.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Interactive console input
- ✅ Immediate odd/even classification
- ✅ Simple and clean output
- ✅ Lightweight and fast execution
- ✅ Educational code structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler or any C compiler
- Terminal/Command prompt access

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0PKunal/number_checker.git
   cd number_checker
   ```

2. **Compile the program**
   ```bash
   gcc number_checker.c -o number_checker
   ```

3. **Run the executable**
   ```bash
   ./number_checker        # On Linux/macOS
   number_checker.exe      # On Windows
   ```

## 💻 Usage

1. Run the program
2. Enter any integer when prompted
3. The program will display whether the number is odd or even

**Example:**
```
$ ./number_checker
Enter a number: 42
42 is a even number.
```

## 🔍 Code Explanation

The program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to determine if a number is divisible by 2:

- **Even numbers**: `number % 2 == 0` (remainder is 0)
- **Odd numbers**: `number % 2 != 0` (remainder is 1)

### Key Components:

- `scanf("%d", &num)`: Reads integer input from user
- `num % 2 == 0`: Checks if number is divisible by 2
- `printf()`: Displays the result to console

## ⚠️ Known Issues

**Bug Alert**: The current code has a logical error where the output messages are reversed:

```c
if (num % 2 == 0) 
    printf("%d is a odd number.\n", num);    // Should say "even"
else 
    printf("%d is a even number.\n", num);   // Should say "odd"
```

**Fix**: Swap the printf statements or change the condition logic.

## 🛠️ Improvements

Here are some suggested enhancements:

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix the logical error in odd/even determination
- [ ] Add input validation for non-integer inputs
- [ ] Handle buffer overflow protection

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add support for negative numbers
- [ ] Implement error handling for invalid inputs
- [ ] Add command-line argument support

### Low Priority
- [ ] Create a version that processes multiple numbers
- [ ] Add colored output for better visibility
- [ ] Include unit tests

### Enhanced Version Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    char buffer[100];
    
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    
    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) != NULL) {
        num = atoi(buffer);
        
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            printf("%d is an even number.\n", num);
        } else {
            printf("%d is an odd number.\n", num);
        }
    } else {
        printf("Error reading input.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
